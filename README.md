## Cmd usage

### installation

```
git clone https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-cmd.git
cd greenfield-cmd
make build
cd build
./gnfd-cmd -h
```

### basic config 

The command should run with "-c filePath" to load the config file and the config should be TOML format.
The default config file is "config.toml".

Below is an example of the config file. The rpcAddr and chainId should be consistent with the Greenfield network.
For Greenfield Testnet, you can refer to [Greenfield Testnet RPC Endpoints](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/docs/guide/resources.html#rpc-endpoints).
The rpcAddr indicates the Tendermint RPC address with the port info.
The configuration for passwordFile is the path to the file containing the password required to generate or parse the keystore.
Users need to set the password on passwordFile before running commands and the password can be any random string.
```
rpcAddr = "https://gnfd-testnet-fullnode-tendermint-us.bnbchain.org:443"
chainId = "greenfield_5600-1"
passwordFile = "password.txt"
```

#### Get help

The commands support different categories, including storage,group,bridge,bank,permission and payment 
```
// get help for supporing commands and basic command format
gnfd-cmd -h
   bucket           support the bucket operation functions, including create/update/delete/head/list
   object           support the object operation functions, including put/get/update/delete/head/list and so on
   group            support the group operation functions, including create/update/delete/head/head-member
   crosschain       support the cross-chain functions, including transfer and mirror
   bank             support the bank functions
   policy           support object policy and bucket policy operation functions
   payment          support the payment operation functions
   sp               support the storage provider operation functions
   create-keystore  create a new keystore file

```

The following command can be used to obtain help information for classified commands. For example, you can use "gnfd-cmd object -h" to obtain the subcommand infos under the object command.
```
gnfd-cmd [category-name] -h
```

The following command can be used to obtain help information for subcommands. For example, you can use "gnfd-cmd object update -h" to obtain the help info of "update".
```
gnfd-cmd [category-name][command-name] -h
```
### Precautions

1. The user need to use "create-keystore" command to generate a keystore file first. The content of the keystore is the encrypted private key information, 
and the passwordFile is used for encrypting/decrypting the private key. The other commands need run with -k if the keystore is not the default file path(key.json).

2. The operator account should have enough balance before sending request to greenfield.

3. The cmd tool has ability to intelligently select the correct SP by the info of bucket name and object name in command. Users do not need to specify the address of the SP in the command or config file.

4. The "gnfd://" is a fixed prefix which representing the greenfield resources


### Examples

#### Generate Keystore

Before generate keystore, you should export your private key from MetaMask and write it into a local file as plaintext .
You need also write your password on the password file which set by the "passwordFile" field in the config file.

Assuming that the current private key hex string is written as plaintext in the file key.txt, the following command can be used to generate a keystore file called key.json:
```
// generate keystore key.json
gnfd-cmd create-keystore --privKeyFile key.txt  key.json
```

After the keystore file has been generated, you can delete the private key file which contains the plaintext of private key.

#### Account Operations
```
// transfer to an account in Greenfield
gnfd-cmd bank transfer --toAddress 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d --amount 12345

// query the balance of account
gnfd-cmd bank balance --address 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d

// create a payment account
gnfd-cmd payment create-account

// list payment accounts under owner or a address with optional flag --user 
gnfd-cmd payment ls --owner 0x5a64aCD8DC6Ce41d824638419319409246A9b41A
```

#### Storage Provider Operations

THis command is used to list the SP and query the information of SP.
```
// list storage providers
gnfd-cmd sp ls

// get storage provider info
./gnfd-cmd sp head --spEndpoint https://gnfd-testnet-sp-1.nodereal.io

// get quota price of storage provider:
gnfd-cmd sp get-price --spAddress 0x70d1983A9A76C8d5d80c4cC13A801dc570890819
```

#### Bucket Operations

Before creating bucket, It is recommended to first run the "ls-sp" command to obtain the SP list information of Greenfield,
and then select the target SP to which the bucket will be created on.

```
// create bucket. 
// The targt primary SP address to which the bucket will be created on need to be set by --primarySP flag.
// If the primary SP has not been not set, the cmd will choose first SP in the SP list which obtain from chain as the primary SP.
gnfd-cmd bucket create gnfd://gnfd-bucket

// update bucket visibility, charged quota or payment address
(1) gnfd-cmd bucket update --visibility=public-read gnfd://gnfd-bucket
(2) gnfd-cmd bucket update --chargedQuota 50000 gnfd://gnfd-bucket
```
#### Upload/Download Operations

(1) put Object

The "object put" command is used to upload a file from local which is less than 2G. The bucket name and object name should be replaced with specific names and
the file-path should replace by the file path of local system.
```
gnfd-cmd object put --contentType "text/xml" --visibility private file-path gnfd://gnfd-bucket/gnfd-object
```
if the object name has not been set, the command will use the file name as object name. If you need upload a file to the folder, you need to run "object put" command with "-folder" flag.


The tool also support create a folder on bucket by "storage make-folder" command.
```
./gnfd-cmd object make-folder gnfd://gnfd-bucket/test-folder
```

(2) download object

The "object get" command is used to download an object to local path. This command will return the local file path where the object will be downloaded and the file size after successful execution.
```
gnfd-cmd object get gnfd://gnfd-bucket/gnfd-object file-path 
```
The filepath can be a specific file path, a directory path, or not set at all. 
If not set, the command will download the content to a file with the same name as the object name in the current directory.

It is supported to set the file path as a directory, the command will download the object file into the directory.

#### Group Operations

The group commands is used to create group, update group members, delete group and query group info.
```
// create group
gnfd-cmd group create gnfd://groupname

// update group member
gnfd-cmd group update --addMembers 0xca807A58caF20B6a4E3eDa3531788179E5bc816b gnfd://groupname

// head group member
gnfd-cmd group head-member --headMember 0xca807A58caF20B6a4E3eDa3531788179E5bc816b gnfd://groupname

// delete group
gnfd-cmd group delete gnfd://group-name
```
#### Policy  Operations
```
// The object policy action can be "create", "delete", "copy", "get" , "execute", "list" or "all".
// The bucket policy actions can be "update", "delete", "create", "list", "update", "getObj", "createObj" and so on.
// The actions info can be set with combined string like "create,delete" by --actions
// The policy effect can set to be allow or deny by --effect

// grant object operation permissions to a group
gnfd-cmd policy put-object-policy --groupId 128  --actions get,delete  gnfd://gnfd-bucket/gnfd-object

// grant object operation permissions to an account
gnfd-cmd policy put-object-policy --grantee 0x169321fC04A12c16...  --actions get,delete gnfd://gnfd-bucket/gnfd-object

// grant bucket operation permissions to a group
gnfd-cmd policy put-bucket-policy --groupId 130 --actions delete,update,createObj  gnfd://gnfd-bucket

// grant bucket operation permissions to an account
gnfd-cmd policy put-bucket-policy  --grantee 0x169321fC04A12c16...  --actions delete,update  gnfd://gnfd-bucket

```
