## Cmd usage

### basic config 

The command should run with "-c filePath" to load the config file and the config should be toml format.
The default config file is "config.toml".

Config file example:
```
rpcAddr = "https://gnfd-testnet-fullnode-tendermint-us.bnbchain.org:443"
chainId = "greenfield_5600-1"
passwordFile = "password.txt"
```

```

get help of specific commands 
```
gnfd-cmd [category-name][command-name] -h

for example : gnfd-cmd stroage create-bucket -h
```
### Precautions

1. The private key of the account has to be configured in config file

2. The operator account should have enough balance before sending request to greenfield

3. The cmd tool has ability to intelligently select the correct SP with the info of bucket name and object name in command.

4. The "gnfd://" is a fixed prefix which representing the greenfield resources

5. The command need run with --keystore if the keystore is not the default file path(key.json). The content of the keystore file is the encrypted private key information.

### Examples

#### Generate Keystore

Assuming that the current private key hex string  is written in clear text in the file key.txt and the password is stored in the file password.txt,
the following command can be used to generate a keystore file called key.json:
```
// generate keystore key.json
gnfd-cmd gen-key --privKeyFile key.txt --password password.txt  key.json
```

After the keystore file is generated, other commands need to be run with the addition of "--keystore keystore-path".
The default keystore file is "key.json".

#### Account Operations
```
// transfer to an account in Greenfield
gnfd-cmd bank transfer --toAddress 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d --amount 12345

// query the balance of account
gnfd-cmd bank balance --address 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d

// create a payment account
gnfd-cmd payment create-payment-account

// query payments account under owner or a address with optional flag --user 
gnfd-cmd payment ls-payment-account --owner 0x5a64aCD8DC6Ce41d824638419319409246A9b41A

// deposit from owner's account to the payment account 
gnfd-cmd payment  payment-deposit --toAddress 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d --amount 12345

// witharaw from a payment account to owner's account
gnfd-cmd payment  payment-withdraw --fromAddress 0xF678C3734F0EcDCC56cDE2df2604AC1f8477D55d --amount 12345
```

#### Bucket Operations

```
// create bucket. 
// The primary SP address which the bucket will be created at need to be set by --primarySP
// If the primary SP has not been not set, the cmd will choose SP0 in the SP list as the primary sp
gnfd-cmd storage make-bucket --primarySP  gnfd://bucketname


// update bucket visibility, charged quota or payment address
(1) gnfd-cmd storage update-bucket  --visibility=public-read  gnfd://cmdbucket78
(2) gnfd-cmd storage update-bucket  --chargedQuota 50000 gnfd://cmdbucket78
```
#### Upload/Download Operations

(1) put Object
```
gnfd-cmd storage put --contentType "text/xml" --visibility private file-path  gnfd://bucketname/objectname

```
the file-path should replace by the file path of local system

(2) download object

```
gnfd-cmd storage get gnfd://bucketname/objectname  file-path 
```

the file-path should replace by the file path of local system

#### Group Operations

```
// create group
gnfd-cmd group make-group gnfd://groupname

// update group member
gnfd-cmd group update-group --addMembers 0xca807A58caF20B6a4E3eDa3531788179E5bc816b gnfd://groupname

// head group member
gnfd-cmd group head-member --headMember 0xca807A58caF20B6a4E3eDa3531788179E5bc816b gnfd://groupname
```
#### List Operations

```
// list buckets
gnfd-cmd storage ls-bucket 

// list objects
gnfd-cmd storage ls gnfd://bucketname

```
#### Delete Operations

```
// delete bucekt
gnfd-cmd storage del-bucket gnfd://bucketname

//delete object
gnfd-cmd storage del-obj gnfd://bucketname/objectname

// delete group
gnfd-cmd storage del-group gnfd://group-name
```
#### Head Operations

```
// head bucekt
gnfd-cmd storage head-bucket gnfd://bucket-name

// head object
gnfd-cmd storage head-obj gnfd://bucket-name/object-name

// head Group
gnfd-cmd group head-group gnfd://groupname
```

#### Permission  Operations
```
// The object policy actions can be "create", “delete”, "copy", "get" or "execute"
// The bucket policy actions can be "update" or "delete"， "update" indicate the updating bucket info permission
// The actions info can be set with combined string like "create,delete" by --actions
// The policy effect can set to be allow or deny by --effect

// grant object operation permissions to a group
gnfd-cmd permission put-obj-policy --groupId 128  --actions get,delete  gnfd://bucket-name/object-name

// grant object operation permissions to an account
gnfd-cmd permission put-obj-policy --granter 0x169321fC04A12c16...  --actions get,delete gnfd://bucket-name/object-name

// grant bucket operation permissions to a group
gnfd-cmd permission put-bucket-policy --groupId 130 --actions delete,update  gnfd://bucket-name

// grant bucket operation permissions to an account
gnfd-cmd permission put-bucket-policy  --granter 0x169321fC04A12c16...  --actions delete,update  gnfd://bucket-name

```

#### Storage Provider Operations

```
// list storage providers
gnfd-cmd -c config.toml ls-sp

// get quota price of storage provider:
gnfd-cmd payment get-price --spAddress 0x70d1983A9A76C8d5d80c4cC13A801dc570890819
```
#### Payment Operations

```
// get quota info
gnfd-cmd payment quota-info gnfd://bucketname

// buy quota
gnfd-cmd payment buy-quota --chargedQuota 1000000 gnfd://bucket-name
```
#### Hash Operations

```
// compute integrity hash
gnfd-cmd storage get-hash filepath

```

#### Crosschain Operations
```
// crosschain transfer some tokens to an account in BSC
gnfd-cmd crosschain transfer-out --toAddress "0x2eDD53b48726a887c98aDAb97e0a8600f855570d" --amount 12345

// mirror a group to BSC
gnfd-cmd crosschain mirror --resource group --id 1

// mirror a bucket to BSC
gnfd-cmd crosschain mirror --resource bucket --id 1

// mirror a object to BSC
gnfd-cmd crosschain mirror --resource object --id 1
```
